Collaborative folder for Project 1. This project is a music library format that takes in a file and outputs the info as per the lab writeup. / 
We worked well, splitting the outline and implementation well. The majority of this project was getting familiarized with branching and / 
collaborative git, so we bonded by not completely understanding what was happening most of the time.
